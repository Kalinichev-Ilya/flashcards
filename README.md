# Flashcards

A flash card is a piece of paper, 
on one side is written a word in 
one language, on the other side - 
on the other. Such cards are very 
popular for learning languages. 
Most often, these cards are used 
with the system of interval 
repetitions. This means that each 
card is repeated at increasing 
intervals.

As I write the application, 
I plan to learn the following things:

 - A simple CRUD in Rails
 - Writing Business Logic
 - Writing tests
 - Authorization, authentication with Sorcery
 - Background tasks
 - API
 - Deleted on VPS
 
Well, a lot of everything else :)
